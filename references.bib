  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Over the past two decades, a steeply growing number of persons with chronic non-cancer pain have been using opioid analgesics chronically to treat it, accompanied by a markedly increased prevalence of individuals with opioid-related misuse, opioid use disorders, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, admissions to drug treatment programs, and drug overdose deaths. This opioid misuse and overdose epidemic calls for well-designed randomized-controlled clinical trials into more skillful and appropriate pain management and for developing effective analgesics that have lower abuse liability and are protective against stress induced by chronic non-cancer pain. However, incomplete knowledge regarding effective approaches to treat various types of pain has been worsened by an under-appreciation of overlapping neurobiological mechanisms of stress, stress-induced relapse to opioid use, and chronic non-cancer pain in patients presenting for care for these conditions. This insufficient knowledge base has unfortunately encouraged common prescription of conveniently available opioid pain-relieving drugs with abuse liability, as opposed to treating underlying problems using team-based multidisciplinary, patient-centered, collaborative-care approaches for addressing pain and co-occurring stress and risk for opioid use disorder. This paper reviews recent neurobiological findings regarding overlapping mechanisms of stress-induced relapse to opioid misuse and chronic non-cancer pain, and then discusses these in the context of key outstanding evidence gaps and clinical-treatment research directions that may be pursued to fill these gaps. Such research directions, if conducted through well-designed randomized-controlled trials, may substantively inform clinical practice in general medical settings on how to effectively care for patients presenting with pain-related distress and these common co-occurring conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {IntroductionConcomitant opioid abuse is a serious problem among patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for opioid use disorder. This is an exploratory study that aims to identify predictors of the length of time a patient receiving MMT for opioid use disorder remains abstinent (relapse-free).MethodsData were collected from 250 MMT patients enrolled in addiction treatment clinics across Southern Ontario. The impact of certain clinical and socio-demographic factors on the outcome (time until opioid relapse) was determined using a Cox proportional hazard model.ResultsHistory of injecting drug use behavior (hazard ratio (HR): 2.26, P = 0.042), illicit benzodiazepine consumption (HR: 1.07, P = 0.002), and the age of onset of opioid abuse (HR: 1.10, P {$<$} 0.0001) are important indicators of accelerated relapse among MMT patients. Conversely, current age is positively associated with duration of abstinence from illicit opioid use, serving as a protective factor against relapse (HR: 0.93, P = 0.003).ConclusionThis study helps to identify patients at increased risk of relapse during MMT, allowing health care providers to target more aggressive adjunct therapies toward high-risk patients.},

  abstract = {Background The opioid crisis in the United States is of public health significance, with an estimated 128 opioid overdose-related deaths per day in 2018 and a relapse rate of 90\% or higher. This crisis persists despite the adoption of Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT), therefore, there is a need to prevent relapse. Aims The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors for relapse in patients admitted with opioid use disorder (OUD) at a local addiction treatment center in Western New York, from 2018-2020. The aims were to compare rates of relapse to illicit substances between patients with OUD and chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) to those with OUD alone; and to determine factors that predict relapse. Method A retrospective chart review design was used. Electronic health records of 75 patients with OUD were reviewed. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic data; and a {$\chi$}2 test was performed to compare relapse rates in patients with OUD plus CNCP to those with OUP alone. Binary logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effects of psychiatric comorbidities on relapse. Results There was no statistically significant difference between demographic subgroups. No group differences were observed in rates of relapse; however, patients with CNCP were more likely to relapse (p = .06). Psychiatric comorbidities did not predict relapse (p {$>$} .05). Conclusions Additional research is needed to ascertain other factors predicting relapse in patients with OUD in addiction treatment centers.},

  abstract = {Background:~           Although our understanding about neurobiology of opioid dependence and availability of pharmacological treatment has gone a long way in the last few decades, psychosocial interventions play a pivotal role in the prevention of relapse owing to reasons such as less treatment-seeking behavior and poor penetrance of opioid substitution treatment. There are many studies assessing psychosocial factors in alcohol and nicotine dependence, yet the availability of such studies for opioid dependence is sparse. This study aimed at evaluating the association of relapse in opioid dependence with various psychosocial factors.           Materials and Methods:~           This was a cross-sectional study with two groups of opioid dependence patients: In abstinence (N = 28) and relapse (N = 33). Psychosocial variables such as high-risk situations, coping behavior, stressful life events, self-efficacy, and social support were assessed in the two groups and analyzed for the association with opioid relapse.           Results:~           This study reports that more high risk situations (odds ratio [OR] =1.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI] =1.22--2.03; P = 0.017), especially negative mood state and undesirable stressful life events (OR = 2.08; 95\% CI = 1.28--3.37; P = 0.05) were significantly associated with higher odds of relapse in patients of opioid dependence. Further, higher self-efficacy (OR = 0.92; 95\% CI = 0.87--0.96; P = 0.017) was significantly associated with lower odds of relapse.           Conclusion:~           Psychosocial factors such as high risk situations, undesirable stressful life events, and self-efficacy were significantly associated with relapse in opioid dependence. Hence, practice of a holistic, multimodal, and individualized treatment plan addressing these factors might help in reducing the relapse rates in them.},

  abstract = {Aims In a sample of patients receiving opioid agonist therapy, we evaluated whether having chronic pain was associated with (a) craving for opioids and (b) illicit opioid use. Methods In a cross-sectional study of adults on buprenorphine or methadone maintenance recruited from an urban medical center, we examined any craving for opioids (primary dependent variable) in the past week and recent illicit opioid use (secondary dependent variable). Illicit opioid use was defined as a positive urine drug test (UDT) for opiates and chronic pain was defined as bodily pain that had been present for at least 3 months. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit for each outcome, adjusting for age, sex, and non-white race. Additional models adjusted for depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (STAI). Results The sample included 105 adults on methadone or buprenorphine maintenance. Mean age was 43.8 (SD {\textpm}9.4)years; 48\% were female and 32\% non-white; 19\% were on methadone. Chronic pain was present in 68\% of the sample, 51\% reported craving opioids in the past week, and 16\% had a positive UDT. Chronic pain was associated with 3-fold higher odds of reporting craving in the past week (aOR=3.10; 95\% CI: 1.28--7.50, p-value=0.01). The relative odds for having a positive UDT were not statistically significant (aOR=2.52; 95\% CI: 0.64--9.90, p=0.18). Conclusion In this sample of patients treated with opioid agonist therapy, those with chronic pain had higher odds of reporting craving for opioids. Chronic pain with associated opioid craving potentially places this population at risk for relapse.},

  abstract = {Background Relapse is common in treatment for opioid use disorders (OUDs). Pain and depression often co-occur during OUD treatment, yet little is known about how they influence relapse among patients with a primary diagnosis of prescription opioid use disorder (POUD). Advanced statistical analyses that can simultaneously model these two conditions may lead to targeted clinical interventions. Method The objective of this study was to utilize a discrete survival analysis with a growth mixture model to test time to prescription opioid relapse, predicted by parallel growth trajectories of depression and pain, in a clinical sample of patients in buprenorphine/naloxone treatment. The latent class analysis characterized heterogeneity with data collected from the National Institute of Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network project (CTN-0030). Results Results suggested that a 4-class solution was the most parsimonious based on global fit indices and clinical relevance. The 4 classes identified were: 1) low relapse, 2) high depression and moderate pain, 3) high pain, and 4) high relapse. Odds ratios for time-to-first use indicated no statistically significant difference in time to relapse between the high pain and the high depression classes, but all other classes differed significantly. Conclusion This is the first longitudinal study to characterize the influence of pain, depression, and relapse in patients receiving buprenorphine and naloxone treatment. These results emphasize the need to monitor the influence of pain and depression during stabilization on buprenorphine and naloxone. Future work may identify appropriate interventions that can be introduced to extend time-to-first prescription opioid use among patients.},
